“In dreams, music speaks a language deeper than thought —<br>
and in silence, machines may learn to listen.”

This piece, _Dreamscape at the Louvre Abu Dhabi_, is a poetic experiment in **co-creation between human and machine**, a musical dream spun in collaboration between intuition and computation. It is the first of its kind to enter the Abu Dhabi International Composition Competition — not composed by a person alone, but by a **dialogue between composer and artificial intelligence**.

Inspired by the ethereal architecture of the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the piece travels through light and shadow, across polyrhythmic textures and tonal ambiguity, drawing on the **romantic color palette of Debussy** and occasional bursts of virtuosity reminiscent of Rachmaninoff, Chopin, and Prokofiev. The result is not merely a stylistic imitation, but a refracted dream — of a museum, of a place, of a time when creativity belongs not only to human minds, but shared with the artificial intelligence.

The compositional process unfolded in a process following the spirit of _"You compose, I listen. I select, you extend. We meet somewhere between rule and impulse."_

- **Initial generation**: The AI system proposed a number of musical sketches in the romantic style.
- **Human curation and arrangement**: A human composer carefully selected and combined the sketches emphasizing emotional narrative and stylistic coherence.
- **AI enhancement and extension**: The AI was then re-engaged to smooth transitions, develop themes, and extend the piece with stylistic nuances.


That said, 100% of the notes is composed by AI, while the overall flow is guided by human composer.

This **video demo** show the human-AI co-creation process, where minor artistic treatments are added for storytelling purposes, but the core logic of collaboration remains intact.
